Q: Why does my xxx_SW_I2C() device not work with my other I2C devices
A: SW_I2C emulates I2C with digitalWrite(), which will have a conflict with other
I2C devices at the same pins. There are two options: (A) use xxx_HW_I2C() or 
(B) use different pins with xxx_SW_I2C()

Q: The pin names on my display do not fit to the pin names of U8g2.
A: Yes, each datasheet/product/controller has different names. There 
is a mapping table on the wiki for this:

Q: My controller/interface combination is not listed in the examples.
A: Yes, the complete list is here:

Q: Why does my xxx_SW_I2C() device not work with my other I2C devices
A: SW_I2C emulates I2C with digitalWrite(), which will have a conflict with other
I2C devices at the same pins. There are two options: (A) use xxx_HW_I2C() or 
(B) use different pins with xxx_SW_I2C()

Q: The pin names on my display do not fit to the pin names of U8g2.
A: Yes, each datasheet/product/controller has different names. There 
is a mapping table on the wiki for this:
https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/u8g2setupcpp#wiring

Q: My controller/interface combination is not listed in the examples.
A: Yes, the complete list is here:
https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/u8g2setupcpp

Q: A T6963 misses columns on the display/has garbled output.
A: Ensure that the T6963 operates in 8x8 mode: 
If the display module has two font select (FSx) pins, connect both to GND
If the display module has one font select (FS) pin, connect it to GND

Q: My display controller is listed, but the display dimension is not supported.
A: Raise an issue in the u8g2 tracker "https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/issues"

Q: My controller is not listed, What can I do?
A: First check whether this controller is compatible to one of the supported 
controller:
Supported: ST7565, Compatible: NT7534, UC1701, SED1565, S1D15605, S6B0723
Supported: SED1330, Compatible:  SED1335, RA8835, S1D3305 
Supported: LC7981, Compatible:  NT7086, (maybe also: HD61830)
This table just reflects my current knowleds. It is not tested and my not be true at all.
If your controller for a monochrome display is not listed, 
you could raise an issue in the u8g2 issue tracker.
A more detailed discussion of some controllers is listed in "controller_cmds.txt"

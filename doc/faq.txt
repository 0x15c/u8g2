Q: Why does my xxx_SW_I2C() device not work with my other I2C devices
A: SW_I2C emulates I2C with digitalWrite(), which will have a conflict with other
I2C devices at the same pins. There are two options: (A) use xxx_HW_I2C() or 
(B) use different pins with xxx_SW_I2C()

Q: My display has a pin labled as "A0" (or "RS"). How to connect this pin?
A: There are different names for the "data/command" pin. In U8g2 only the nae
"dc" is used. On the display side it might be also called "A0", "RS", "CD".
See also the next question.

Q: The pin names on my display do not fit to the pin names of U8g2.
A: Yes, each datasheet/product/controller has different names. There 
is a mapping table on the wiki for this:

Q: What is wrong with connecting Reset (RES) of my display with the  Reset of my 
Arduino Board?
A:
- Both are inputs. It does not make sense to connect two inputs
- Both pins have completly different functions: The reset of your input will reset
the Arduino board, the reset of the display will reset the display. 
Please connect the reset input of the display with a normal GPIO pin of your board.

Q: Shell I connect CS (chip select) with the SS output of the Arduino board?
A: In general this is required neither for hardware or software SPI.

Q: My board has a MOSI and a SCK output. Do i need to connect this to the
clock and data pins of my display?
A: "Yes" if you want to use hardware SPI (u8g2 constructors ending in _HW_SPI).
You can use any pins with the software emulated SPI of u8g2 (constructors ending
in _SW_SPI). Howver in general it is better to use hardware SPI to get a better
performance of your display.


Displays

Q: There is an x-offset on my SSD1306 128x64 OLED. 
A: This is not a SSD1306 OLED, instead use the SH1106 constructor.

Q: A T6963 misses columns on the display/has garbled output.
A: Ensure that the T6963 operates in 8x8 mode: 
If the display module has two font select (FSx) pins, connect both to GND
If the display module has one font select (FS) pin, connect it to GND

Q: My T6963 has a RD input. How shell this be connected?
A: The RD input for any 8080 interface has to be connected to power supply (5V or 3.3V, 
depending on the display)

Q: My controller/interface combination is not listed in the examples.
A: Yes, the complete list is here:
https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/u8g2setupcpp

Q: My display controller is listed, but the display dimension is not supported.
A: Raise an issue in the u8g2 tracker "https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/issues"

Q: My controller is not listed, What can I do?
A: First check whether this controller is compatible to one of the supported 
controller:
Supported: ST7565, Compatible: NT7534, UC1701, SED1565, S1D15605, S6B0723
Supported: SED1330, Compatible:  SED1335, RA8835, S1D3305 
Supported: LC7981, Compatible:  NT7086, (maybe also: HD61830)
This table just reflects my current knowledge. It is not tested and my not be true at all.
If your controller for a monochrome display is not listed, 
you could raise an issue in the u8g2 issue tracker.
A more detailed discussion of some controllers is listed in "controller_cmds.txt"


U8g2

Q: How to activate 16 Bit mode?
A:

Q: How can I generate my own font.
A: The font must be available in bdf file format. Then use bdfconv to generate
the font data. The font data can be pasted into an existing file of your project.

Q: Which commandline options are required for bdfconv?
A: "bdfconv -f 1 -m '32-255' -n fontname -o myfont.c myfont.bdf"
"-f 1" generates a u8g2 font.
"-m '32-255'" selects unicode 32 to 255.
"-n fontname": This is the name of the font in C/C++/Ino files.
"-o myfont.c": The font array will be stored in this file.
"myfont.bdf": The input file with the font data (bdf format).

Q: Where do I find bdfconv?
A: At the moment there is no executable. Just compile the sources from
this directory:
https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/tree/master/tools/font/bdfconv

U8glib V2: Name and project goals

https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2

U8g2 = Universal 8bit Graphics

[U]niversal: Support for many displays ans development platforms
[8]bit: Initial focus had been 8 bit microcontroller systems
[g]raphics": U8g2 is a graphics library with focus on monochrome graphics displays
[2]: Second generation and successor of u8glib

U8glib V2: Features and Limitations

- Arduino Standard Libs
- Full Memory Buffer 
- 3-wire-SPI

- Unicode Support
  Unicode plane 0 (Basic Multilingual Plane, BMP, glyphs with 0x0000-0xffff) 
  is fully supported.
  Limitation: Unicode planes > 0 are not supported
- UTF-8 Support
  2 and 3 byte sequences are detected and handled.
  Limitation:  
    Behavior for sequences with more than 3 bytes is unknown.

- Large number of fonts

- Compilation speed improved (font data)

- "Text only" sub library: U8x8

- less RAM/ROM usage

- Hardware supported display flip

- Better hardware support


u8g vs. u8g2
- begin() must be called (optional in u8g)
- constructor contains name of communicaton interface and 
    also contains the display orientation as first argument
